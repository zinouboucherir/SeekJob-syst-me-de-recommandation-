In general, house prices have nonlinear and clustering properties. Thus, in this study, a support vector regression (SVR) model was used to perform district classification and the results are presented in this thesis. We executed the following procedures: First, the house data were classified according to the district in which the house was located. Second, the classifications conducted in the first stage were used to establish the SVR model, which was used to reduce the complexity of the problem. The proposed model is highly nonlinear and complex. Thus we present an iterative algorithm based on a genetic algorithm for optimizing the parameters of the DCSVR model.","2":"Low Cost Flight-Test Platform to Demonstrate Flight Dynamics Concepts using Frequency-Domain System Identification Methods2013-08Paul M.

Strong optical contrast is observed in the visible wavelength, mainly because of the dipolar plasmon resonance of the embedded Au nanoparticles which is absent in the infrared. We show that the use of small tapping amplitude improves the apparent image contrast in nanoparticles by causing increased tip-particle and reduced tip-substrate interactions. Experimental results are in excellent agreement with extended dipole model calculations modified to include the capping layer characterized by its refractive index.Near-field infrared nanoscopy of phonon resonant silica and silica-coated gold nanoparticleshttps:\/\/briefs.techconnect.org\/wp-content\/volumes\/Nanotech2011v1\/pdf\/1121.pdf2011-06Single silica capped and uncapped gold nanoparticles are imaged using apertureless near-field optical microscopy (ANSOM) in the visible (\u03bb=632 nm) and infrared frequencies (\u03bb=10.7 \u00b5m). Identification of capped and uncapped particles with nanoscale spatial resolution is demonstrated at both in the visible and infrared frequencies. It is shown that the optical contrast depends strongly on the vertical composition of the sample. Experimental evidence is provided that the near-field probing depths improves with increasing tapping amplitude of the probing tip. Previous works have shown that ANSOM can image structures beneath surfaces. The work here demonstrates for the first time that by using nanoparticles as small as 30 nm in diameter that ANSOM can not only distinquish between bare silica and silica capped-gold core nanoparticles, it can also image the polarization states of the metal core nanoparticle below the silica capping layer. Experimental results are in very good agreement with dielectric function model calculations which includes vertical composition of the nanoparticles in the extended dipole approximation. From these calculations the thickness of the capping layer is determined.Nanoscale near-field infrared spectroscopic imaging of silica- shell\/ gold-core and pure silica nanoparticleshttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11051-012-0766-z2012-02Spectroscopic near-field imaging of single silica-shell\/Au-core and pure silica nanoparticles deposited on a silicon substrate is performed in the infrared wavelength range (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a09\u201311\u00a0\u03bcm) using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). By tuning the wavelength of the incident light, we have acquired information on the spectral phonon\u2013polariton resonant near-field interactions of the silica-shell\/Au-core and pure silica nanoparticles with the probing tip. We made use of the enhanced near-field coupling between the high index Au-core and the probing tip to achieve spectral near-field contrast of the thin silica coating (thickness\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0nm).

While this method is functional, it can be inefficient because many of the commonly used mathematical operations are either redundant or unnecessary. This paper addresses these two inefficiencies by proposing both the use of look-up tables to prevent redundant calculations, and the use of a sorting method to allow the prevention of unnecessary calculations. Either technique, by itself, results in a large reduction in computation time. The greatest time reductions, however, can be achieved when both techniques are used together.Rhythm-Synchronized Effects Control with Modulation Keying and B\u00e9zier Splineshttp:\/\/dafx09.como.polimi.it\/proceedings\/papers\/paper_10.pdf2009-0912th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects,Politecnico di Milano, Como, ItalyAbstract:This paper discusses details related to the automatic control of effects parameters.

The resulting reverberation effect is qualitatively flawed due to sweeping echoes and flutter. Efficiency is improved with the Fast Image Method, and sweeping echoes can be suppressed by using randomization. With both approaches, however, there is still a remaining problem with flutter. To address all of these issues, the Fast Image Method is modified to have both randomized image locations and increased symmetry. Additional optimizations are proposed and applied to the algorithm. The resulting audio effect has improved quality, and the computation time is dramatically reduced (by a factor usually exceeding 200) when compared to its ancestral Allen and Berkley algorithm. Some relevant perceptual considerations are also discussed.\u00a0","8":"Parallel Programming Paradigms for Reliability - based Design Optimization with Discrete Design Variableshttp:\/\/pc01.lib.ntust.edu.tw\/ETD-db\/ETD-search-c\/view_etd?URN=etd-0720112-1333532012-08Master's ThesisMining Association Rules in a Bridge Deterioration Databasehttp:\/\/www.ctresources.info\/ccp\/paper.html?id=50182008-09Undergraduate ResearchEstimating Bridge Performance Using Time Series Analysishttp:\/\/www.ctresources.info\/ccp\/paper.html?id=50192008-09Undergraduate Research","9":".NET Common Language Runtime2001-04Features of CLR explained and shown how to use.","10":"Overview of Virtual Prototyping Techniques for  System Development and Validationhttps:\/\/www.onlinejournal.in\/IJIRV3I4\/370.pdf2017-06","11":"Cross platform (RDBMS to NoSQL) database validation tool using bloom filterhttps:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/75695372016-04A platform to validate huge datasets during migration from NoSQL to RDBMS databases and pinpoint the exact corrupted records in constant space and linear time complexity up to a desired error probability.","12":"The Influence of Community Interactions on User Affinity in Social Networks: A Facebook Case Studyhttps:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/8550063\/metrics#metrics2018-10A Weighted Network Analysis of User Migrations in a Social Network2018-09Published in International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions ICTer2018","13":"Performance Analysis of Baseband Modulation Techniques for Visible Light Communicationhttps:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/cb64\/53d1faf6ed8c898ea4ff8ab4b4aa44a1374e.pdfUnfolding the Potential of IBeaconhttp:\/\/www.iraj.in\/journal\/journal_file\/journal_pdf\/12-135-143142490572-76.pdf","14":"On the Design and Implementation of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networkshttp:\/\/airccse.org\/journal\/ijngn\/papers\/0910ijngn03.pdf2010-09In my summer internship, I was able to work on a wireless sensor network that would monitor a specific area of land and be able to send that raw data wirelessly to a computer or database for further processing and analysis.

At 12 h-1 Mpc, the observed genus curve has a symmetric form similar to that predicted for a Gaussian random field. At the shorter smoothing lengths, the observed genus curve shows a modest shift in the direction of an isolated cluster or \"meatball\" topology. We use mock catalogs drawn from cosmological N-body simulations to investigate the systematic biases that affect topology measurements in samples of this size and to determine the full covariance matrix of the expected random errors. We incorporate the error correlations into our evaluations of theoretical models, obtaining both frequentist assessments of absolute goodness of fit and Bayesian assessments of models' relative likelihoods. We compare the observed topology of the 1.2 Jy survey to the predictions of dynamically evolved, unbiased, gravitational instability models that have Gaussian initial conditions. The model with an n = -1 power-law initial power spectrum achieves the best overall agreement with the data, though models with a low-density cold dark matter power spectrum and an n = 0 power-law spectrum are also consistent. The observed topology is inconsistent with an initially Gaussian model that has n = -2, and it is strongly inconsistent with a Voronoi foam model, which has a non-Gaussian, bubble topology.Local Lagrangian Approximations for the Evolution of the Density Distribution Function in Large-Scale Structure (Protogeros, Z.A.M. & Scherrer, R.J. 1997, MNRAS, 284, 425)http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1997MNRAS.284..425P1997-01We examine local Lagrangian approximations for the gravitational evolution of the density distribution function. In these approximations, the final density at a Lagrangian point q at a time t is taken to be a function only of t and the initial density at the same Lagrangian point. A general expression is given for the evolved density distribution function for such approximations, and we show that the vertex generating function for a local Lagrangian mapping applied to an initially Gaussian density field bears a simple relation to the mapping itself. Using this result, we design a local Lagrangian mapping which reproduces nearly exactly the hierarchical amplitudes given by perturbation theory for gravitational evolution. When extended to smoothed density fields and applied to Gaussian initial conditions, this mapping produces a final density distribution function in excellent agreement with full numerical simulations of gravitational clustering. We also examine the application of these local Lagrangian approximations to non-Gaussian initial conditions.Skewness of the Large-Scale Velocity Divergence from Non-Gaussian Initial Conditions (Protogeros, Z.A.M. & Scherrer, R.J. 1997, MNRAS, 286, 223)http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1997MNRAS.286..223P1997-03We compute the skewness t_3 and the corresponding hierarchical amplitude T_3 of the divergence of the velocity field for arbitrary non-Gaussian initial conditions. We find that T_3 qualitatively resembles the corresponding hierarchical amplitude for the density field, S_3, in that it contains a term proportional to the initial skewness, which decays inversely as the linear growth factor, plus a constant term which differs from the corresponding Gaussian term by a complex function of the initial three- and four-point functions. We extend the results for S_3 and T_3 with non-Gaussian initial conditions to evolved fields smoothed with a spherical top-hat window function. We show that certain linear combinations, namely S_3+\u00bdT_3, S_3+T_3 and s_3+t_3, lead to expressions which are much simpler, for non-Gaussian initial conditions, than S_3 and T_3 (or s_3 and t_3) considered separately.Testing Tree-Level Perturbation Theory for Large Scale Structure with the Local Lagrangian Approximation (Protogeros, Z.A.M., Melott, A.L., Scherrer, R.

Our results indicate that our approximation correctly reproduces the evolved density PDF for n=-1 and -2 power spectra up to the weakly non-linear regime, while it shows marginal agreement for power indices n=0 and +1 in the linear regime and poor agreement beyond this point. This suggests that tree-level perturbation theory (as realized in the LLA) can accurately predict the density distribution function for n<=-1, but fails for n>=0.Deep Learning Hype...rbolehttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/deep-learning-hyperbole-zack-protogeros\/2017-11LinkedIn  articleUnited We Errhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/united-we-err-zack-protogeros\/2017-04LinkedIn articleNavigating Data Science Projectshttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/navigating-data-science-projects-zack-protogeros\/2018-02LinkedIn article","16":"Internet of Things- Governance modelhttps:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/79432122017-06Over the years Internet of Things-like environments have been gaining popularity.

A group at Australian National University (ANU) recently developed open-source code that can detect fundamental topological features of a grayscale image in a computationally feasible manner. This is made possible by the fact that computers store grayscale images as cubical cellular complexes. These complexes can be studied using the techniques of discrete Morse theory. We expand the functionality of the ANU code by introducing methods and software for analyzing images encoded in red, green, and blue (RGB), because this image encoding is very popular for publicly available data. Our methods allow the extraction of key topological information from RGB images via informative persistence diagrams by introducing novel methods for transforming RGB-to-grayscale. This paradigm allows us to perform data analysis directly on RGB images representing water scarcity variability as well as crime variability. We introduce software enabling a a user to predict future image properties, towards the eventual aim of more rapid image-based data behavior prediction.","18":"Biologically Inspired Augmented Memory Recall Model for Pattern Recognitionhttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-94307-7_112018-05","19":"Interpreting and Evaluating CESIfo\u2019s World Economic Survey\u2019s Directional Forecastshttps:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S026499931300535X2014-02Using the Carlson and Parkin (1975) framework and employing the Pesaran\u2013Timmermann (1992) Predictive Failure statistic, we evaluate several consensus forecast series from CESIfo's World Economic Survey.

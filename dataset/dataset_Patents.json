{"0":{"0":"Role Oriented Database Record Field Security Model (#US 9,223,807 B2)https:\/\/www.google.co.in\/patents\/US92238072015-12A database management system implements a role-oriented authorization scheme that facilitates operating system (OS) supported encrypted field access for a table in the database. A security model provides for various roles that have varying responsibilities and rights with respect to the database tables and the data supported therein. In this approach, data that is considered sensitive is encrypted. A system administrator role is authorized to create, update, and maintain a table but is not authorized to view sensitive field data, i.e., data stored in encrypted columns of the table. A security administrator role is authorized to define column masks with OS-enforced security access control to the sensitive field data. By separating (fencing) these responsibilities, the security model enforces end-to-end encryption across the entire database management system.","1":"Employing parallel processing for routing calls (#US7860012)http:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US7860012Method and apparatus for optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) (#US6674518)http:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US6674518Method and apparatus for accessing legacy data in a standardized environment (#US20040210631)http:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US20040210631","2":"System and method for testing information handling system components (#US20080262759A1)https:\/\/patents.google.com\/patent\/US20080262759"}}
